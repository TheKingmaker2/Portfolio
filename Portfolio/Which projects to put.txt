To be honest. The only projects in TOP worth putting in your portfolio is the shopping cart and the final project (clone). Those are typically the most straight forward and 
the type of projects you will be working on on a real job setting. Shopping cart is an E-commerce sort of project, and a clone isâ€¦ well a clone of a common app. Of course you 
will have to add features to it to make it more presentable. That part is on you and will require your own research. All the other projects (TicTacToe, Battleship, 
Etch-a-sketch etc) are projects to help you learn syntax and understand concepts. Not worth putting in your portfolio. 99% of fresh SE all have a tictactoe or a todo list as 
a portfolio project. Not unique nor beneficial to future employers
